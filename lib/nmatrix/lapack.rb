# This file contains LAPACK functions accessible in their C versions,
# e.g., NMatrix::LAPACK::clapack_func. There are some exceptions,
# such as clapack_gesv, which is implemented in Ruby but calls
# clapack_getrf and clapack_getrs.
#
# Note: most of these functions are borrowed from ATLAS, which is available under a BSD-
# style license.

      # clapack_gesv computes the solution to a system of linear equations
      #   A * X = B,
      # where A is an N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
      # The LU factorization used to factor A is dependent on the Order parameter,
      # as detailed in the leading comments of clapack_getrf.
      # The factored form of A is then used solve the system of equations A * X = B.
      # A is overwritten with the appropriate LU factorization, and B, which
      # contains B on input, is overwritten with the solution X on output.

      # From ATLAS 3.8.0.
